## API by example

This is a fairly exhaustive example of Immutable React Form. It aims to demonstrate a reasonably complex use case.

- A form model with
    - Nested fields
    - And arrays
- Custom text fields with Material UI
- Validation
    - Simple validation to prove the length of a field
    - Async validation on Username (to check against a "server")
- Async submission

On the right (or below for smaller screens) you'll see the working example.
